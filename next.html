				First of all, it all started in december 1996 when my mother
				realized that the pregnancy wasn't going as expected. At
				first, they thought the baby would strangle himself on the
				umbilical cord, but doctor recommended an emergency surgery 
				several weeks before the baby was due.
			</p>
			<p class='second-par'>
				What I'm trying to say is that I wasn't freaking ready for any of this.

			<h1 class='header'>Other things:</h1>
			<p class='first-par'>
				Primum omnium, quod in December Omnia coepi cum MCMXCVI mater
				mea intellexi quia praegnationis est non iens ut expectata.
				Primum infantem esse putant se suffocare umbilicum sed arte
				medicus commendatur aliquot septimanas ante infantem
				existimabant deberi.
			</p>
			<p class='second-par'>
				Quid sum conantes ut dico is quod non aliqua freaking parata sunt.
